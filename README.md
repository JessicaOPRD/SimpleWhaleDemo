# docker-whale

Run me : `docker run -p80:80 ushamandya/whale-example`

Build me: `docker build -t ushamandya/whale-example .`

# Some notes

Experienced issues with:
* Building GitHub cache — it seems the cache is expected to exist first
* Tagging — in VSCode tags are pushed through the command palette: `Git: Push Tags`
